## u7334218 Zane Gates

For Deliverable D2D, I contributed the following new statements of original code:

- Wrote an algorithmic (rather than hard-coded) method for determining the [necessaryRotations()](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7312578/comp1140-ass2-tue12s/-/blob/master/src/comp1140/ass2/gui/Viewer.java#L258-288) to make the die model display an arbitrary orientation.
