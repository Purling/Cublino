Zane - 4/4
- Code looks excellent, very concise and well structured
- Good test covering a range of cases

Ziling - 4/4
- Nice code, good use of classes
- Good test covering a range of cases - although are you testing a functionality
we have already written tests for (applyMove)

Kristy - 3.25/4
- Code is clear, but a bit repetitive. Can you think of a way of using logic to get the orientations rather
than listing all of them?
- Test covers many cases, not invalid die (can test before you implement)
